            This page contains every project I've work on in my journey to learning to code from the latest project I've worked on to the very first one. <br>
            I started with<a class = "links "href="https://www.codecademy.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Codecademy</strong></a>for CSS/HTML & moved to<a class = "links" href="https://www.khanacademy.org/" target="_blank"><strong>Khan Academy</strong></a>for Javascript and SQL.
            I will continue to add to this page as I learn more languages.

                    This project uses most of what I learned about JS in Khan Academy. 
                    I learned objects for this project and then used arrays, for loops, and if statments to build it.
                    It's a work in progress as I'm adding titles of books as I read them during this pandemic.

                    This project taught me how to use arrays and the % operator. 
                    Click around on the canvas to add more rain!
                    It might be my favorite project just for the colors.

                    Have your fortune told with this magic eightball I created using if/else statments for the first time!
                    This is also the first time I learned math statements. 
                    Ask a question and then click on the eightball for your answer!

                    This fishtank project was an introduction into creating functions. I made two different ones for this.
                    If you refresh the page, the bubbles will move to a random place each time on the canvas. 
                    Click on the canvas to see what else happens!

                <p class="project-info">
                    For this project, I was tasked with creating an ad using text commands.
                    I also used mouse commands for the first time. 
                    Move your mouse across the canvas to see what happens!

                <p class="project-info">
                    The third project was more practice using variables, especially for any repetitve information such as positions or size.
                    The project was called "Animal Attack" and was originally the mouse's nose growing too big for the screen.
                    For this site, I have added an "If/Else" statement to repeat the animation. It is now a mouse blowing bubble gum.

                <p class="project-info">
                    The second project was to show my new knowledge of variables and basic animation skills.
                    When transferring it to my portfolio, I added in "If/Else" statements to keep the animation looping for the viewer.

                    For the first project in "Intro to JS", Khan Academy tasks the user with using shapes, color, and strokes using ProcessingJS. 
                    I chose to draw "Fish Tacos with Mango Pico." It was a good entry assignment to start learning JS and to hook the learner (me).
